# Label Studio ML Backend (Table Transformer)

This is a fork of the [Label Studio ML backend SDK](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-ml-backend) that implements the Table Transformer model as a backend to connect to a Label Studio instance for data labeling.

The main code file for the implementation is found in `model.py` under the `table-transformer-backend` folder.
